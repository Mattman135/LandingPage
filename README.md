# LandingPage

This is the first project in The Odin Project foundation course.
It will be a fanpage of Mr James Bond and some information about him.
I will practice my HTML and CSS skills I've learned so far.
I will also practice using Git and GitHub to develop a healthy working habit for coding projects.
